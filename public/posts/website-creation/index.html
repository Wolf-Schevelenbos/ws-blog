In fact, my previous version is still online here. It is empty, because I abandoned it.\nThere is a good reason for that; namely it wasn‚Äôt me at all. It was a Wordpress website hosted on a Belgian host provider called combell. It is‚Ä¶ not the best, if you‚Äôd ask me. It is poorly documented how to do anything else with it than host a simple website on it through a CMS other than Wordpress, Joomla or Drupal. However, from Howest, the university I attend, we received a free domain for it. So I tried it out, and didn‚Äôt like the end result.\nHowever, I love open-source projects. This wasn‚Äôt it for me.\nHugo framework Hugo is an open-source static site generator designed for building fast, lightweight websites, particularly blogs or documentation. It is written in Go (Golang) and is known for its speed and flexibility.\nI got the idea to use Hugo for my blog from 2 YouTube videos which are listed below. My workflow ended up being a blend of these two and info I found in the documentation.\nvideo 1 video 2 Designing a whole website through Vue or React seemed like overkill for this simple website. Hugo generates static HTML files from content written in the Markdown format, making it easy to create and deploy websites and posts without relying on a back-end server.\nThat is much more my speed. However, it did require some figuring out.\nFor one, it is a new framework to me. The exact setup guide can be found in the Hugo Documentation. I‚Äôll just briefly cover the process here anyways for those that need less hand-holding than the documentation provides.\nIt comes down to installing prerequisits like Git, Go and Dart Sass. After that, I double checked the path variables so I can use them from a powershell CLI (as I am working on Windows while at the university, sadly ü•≤) and installed Hugo through choco install hugo-extended.\nThe commands to use Hugo are very straight-forward. hugo new site ws-blog --format yaml sets up a new project using .yaml instead of the default .toml extension, which I am less familiar with.\nHugo has many themes that can be found online, which convert markdown files to HTML with a certain layout. I installed one such theme, PaperMod, as a submodule. Doing it that way allows me to easily update to a later version if and when it comes out. It does require that I mirror its file structure if I want to overwrite its layout pages. Luckily, it seems mostly just fine as-is to me. I‚Äôm not a UI/UX fanatic, less front-end work is why I picked it after all.\n\u003e\u003e git submodule add --depth=1 https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod \u003e\u003e git submodule update --init --recursive For the pages I made an empty archetype with some default meta-data. The posts convert the filename to their title for instance, and always show the time they were created at. I can easily create new posts using hugo new posts/website-creation.md -k post.\nOther pages like the About Page I added manually.\nDeployment When the basics of the site were finished, it was time to set up auto-deployment to the web. I synced it to a new github repository, then setup a pipeline with a domain hoster called ‚ÄúNetlify‚Äù. It gives me 100 GB bandwidth for free, which should be more than enough for this blog in its current state.\nMaking new posts After all is set up, all I have to do now to create a new post is to create a markdown file. I then run hugo server to see what it looks like locally as a website \u0026 build the html with hugo. Finally, I just have to commit the changes and push to my github repository. Auto-deployment takes care of the rest.\n","wordCount":"648","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/%3Cimage%20path/url%3E","datePublished":"2024-12-13T18:17:54+01:00","dateModified":"2024-12-13T18:17:54+01:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Wolf Schevelenbos"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/posts/website-creation/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Wolf's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/favicon.ico"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/ accesskey=h title="Wolf's blog (Alt + H)"><img src=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/ws-blog/assets/icon/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Wolf's blog</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/archives/ title=Archives><span>Archives</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/search/ title="Search (Alt + /)" accesskey=/><span>Search</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/about/ title=About><span>About</span></a></li><li><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/>Home</a>&nbsp;¬ª&nbsp;<a href=https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent">Website Creation</h1><div class=post-description>In this blog post I go over how I created the website you're now reading from.</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2024-12-13 18:17:54 +0100 CET'>December 13, 2024</span>&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;648 words&nbsp;¬∑&nbsp;Wolf Schevelenbos&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=https://github.com/%3cpath_to_repo%3e/content/posts/website-creation.md rel="noopener noreferrer" target=_blank>Suggest Changes</a></div></header><div class=toc><details><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#original-blog>Original blog</a></li><li><a href=#hugo-framework>Hugo framework</a></li><li><a href=#deployment>Deployment</a></li><li><a href=#making-new-posts>Making new posts</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=original-blog>Original blog<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#original-blog>#</a></h2><p>This isn&rsquo;t my first try at making a blog.
