Now this will be a day to remember.

## Event

"Hack the Future" is a yearly hackaton. This year's edition was called "Among the Stars" and featured a space-theme throughout. It was right next to the beautiful station of Antwerp central, so we took an early-morning trainride to get there. The train also took us back home after it was over, which gave us plenty of time to reflect on the plethora of goodies we received and the amazing day we'd had.

They'd made quite the original planner, which I quickly pulled apart by accident. It featured a circular design. The day opened with a briefing, then there were two timeslots for the hackaton itself, which was interrupted by a lunchbreak. After all that was over, there was even a contest (in which Howest did quite well). Lastly, there were some drinks and time to network.

## Lunch

The food at the hackaton was downright excuisite. It was all-in, without any extra fees for snacks or drinks at the site. There were vegitarian options too. Truely, no cost had been saved on our lunchbreak. I highly recommend the event for that alone.

The event even featured free access to Antwerp's zoo, which happened to be right next to the building. Of course, we had to go check it out. We had a really good time there, and that wasn't even the main event!

## Hackaton

A friend and I entered one of the many hackatons organised there that day. It was about SAP, and organized by Flexso, both of which we knew next-to-nothing about.

SAP is an enterprise resource planning (ERP) software used by companies to integrate and manage key business functions. 
It provides tools for finance, sales, inventory, human resources, production, and more, allowing departments to share data in real time. This integration helps improve efficiency, reduce errors, and support decision-making. SAP is widely used by large organizations but also offers solutions for mid-sized businesses.

Flexso is an IT consulting company that focuses on implementing and optimizing SAP solutions for businesses. They help companies streamline processes in areas like finance, logistics, human resources, and analytics using SAP technologies. Flexso also supports digital transformation projects, offering both technical and strategic guidance. Their developers guided us very well during the day.

We were tasked with using SAP software to create a specific piece of software they had in mind. We got our feet wet in the software, but decided to built a front-end application using React. The presentation went quite alright, but it got nowhere near to winning something.

All-in-all it was a really fun day. I also personally learned a lot about SAP software, so it really was a win-win!
