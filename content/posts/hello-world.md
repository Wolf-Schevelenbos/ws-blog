Hello ðŸ‘‹ This is my first blogpost on my first ever blog.

At the time of writing, I'm a student software engineering at Howest University of Applied Sciences.

I'm a little older than most other students in my class though, as this is my second Bachelors. I've already become an Alumni once at Howest after finishing Digital Arts & Entertainment (DAE). A lot of people I tell that to ask my why I'm doing another studies, and pretty soon I will write a blogpost about that.

For now, feel free to look at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolf-schevelenbos-b8b689186/) to get a feel of who I am.
