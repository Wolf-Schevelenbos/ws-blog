This is my first blog. Ever.

The blog itself started out as a graded school project, although I decided to keep it afterwards. I really like the way I can just keep adding new posts by writing Markdown files & pushing it to Git. More info on how I set up this blog can be found in [this post](https://wolfschevelenbos.netlify.app/posts/website-creation/).

But who am I?

My name is Wolf Schevelenbos. I'm an alumnus at Digital Arts & Entertainment. I (briefly) worked at Larian after my studies, but decided I wasn't finished studying quite yet. Currently, I'm studying for my second bachelors at Howest University of Applied Sciences. This time, I'm studying Software Engineering. More info on my studies and other paths in life can be found on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolf-schevelenbos-b8b689186/).
